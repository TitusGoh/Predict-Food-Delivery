About:

  Read in a dataset on online food delivery in the Bangalore region that included descriptive statistics of the people who ordered online food delivery as well as whether they would order again. Explored the data through creating graphs and statistics of the attributes and their relationships. Preprocessed the data through cleaning the data and removing unnecessary attributes. Tested multiple models to review their accuracy but ended up using the Random Forest model for the final model. Created a prediction where if someone input their statistics, it would output whether they would order again.
